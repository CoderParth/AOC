// A gear is any * symbol that is adjacent
// to exactly two part numbers. Its gear ratio
// is the result of multiplying those two numbers together.
//
//
//In this schematic, there are two gears. The first is in
//the top left; it has part numbers 467 and 35, so its gear ratio
//is 16345. The second gear is in the lower right; its gear ratio
// is 451490. (The * adjacent to 617 is not a gear because it
// is only adjacent to one part number.) Adding up all of the
// gear ratios produces 467835.

// What is the sum of all of the gear ratios in your engine schematic?
